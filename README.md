# Seedling_Select
 Seedling Select is a decision support tool for modeling the cost of marker-assisted seedling selection. Currently programmed in Python, Seedling Select v1.0 can estimate selection costs of various marker-assisted seedling selection (MASS) schemes and compare the cost of MASS with phenotypic seedling selection based on users’ input.
