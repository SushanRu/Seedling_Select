# Seedling_Select
 Seedling Select is a decision support tool for modeling the cost of marker-assisted seedling selection. Currently programmed in Python, Seedling Select v1.0 can estimate selection costs of various marker-assisted seedling selection (MASS) schemes and compare the cost of MASS with phenotypic seedling selection based on usersâ€™ input.

To use Seedling Select, you need the latest version of Python.
Download 'scheme-011121.py' and the input template to a local folder. Click 'scheme-011121.py', it should generate an output template file.
To use your own cost data, you can edit the input template file and run the script again.
